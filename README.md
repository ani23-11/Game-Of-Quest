Welcome to Go Hero Go!
This is a text based adventure game.
The player would have a bunch of different battles to choose from.
Every opponent is different from one another, as the level increases it becomes more difficult to win.
Defeating an opponent would give you rewards in the form of coins that you can use to stack up your inventory!
Look-Out for the Curses! They'll deal tons of extra damage until cured.

The Opponents : 

        Tin Man             ->  The Notorious Pawn of Evil.     
        Perverse Knight     ->  The one who swore to fight the Good.                     
        Monster der Nacht   ->  The lurker of the Night.
        Protector of Dark   ->  The one who pledged to bestow Darkness in the world.                    
        Demon Dragon        ->  Conqueror of Worlds.
                       
About the Potions & Gear :

        Health Potion       ->  It'll provide instant 25 health points (Max Health : 100)
        Damage Booster      ->  It'll deal extra 20 damage on the opponent (Base Damage Range : 15-35)
        Invisibility Potion ->  It'll hide the Hero from opponent's next attack
        Anti-Curse          ->  It can be used to remove the Curse effect
